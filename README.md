# documentation of my RNA Seq data analysis pipeline

includes all steps from fastq files to gene ontology analysis

1. FastQC
2. Trimmomatic
3. STAR Alignment
4. Data Analysis in R (Deseq2, GO Term, KEGG, etc.)

note: wrote this code myself so may contain some unecessary steps
hence take with a grain of salt :)
