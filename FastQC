# after downlaoding FastQC from: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/

# cd to folder where .fastq.gz files are stored
# make new folder to store quality reports
mkdir -p qc

# run fastqc on all files at once (check for enough ram first)
fastqc raw_fastq/*.fastq.gz -o qc/ -t 4
# open qc folder, reports are stored in .html files

# optional: summarise one big report for all files together
pip install multiqc
multiqc . -o ./multiqc_output

# all done :)
